# Quick Setup Guide

## Initial Setup

The project has been fully configured and is ready to use! Here's what's already done:

âœ… Next.js 14+ with TypeScript and App Router
âœ… ShadCN UI components installed
âœ… Prisma with SQLite database configured
âœ… Database schema created and migrated
âœ… Default presets seeded (Climb, Summit, Beacon)
âœ… OpenAI integration ready

## Required: Add Your OpenAI API Key

1. Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

2. Add your OpenAI API key by editing `.env.local`:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

Get your API key from: [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

## Running the Application

The dev server should already be running! If not, start it with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## What You'll See

- **Left Column**: Prompt builder with fields for subject, setting, action, lighting, art direction, and extras, plus parameter controls
- **Right Column**: Live preview, AI enhancement button, copy/save/reset tools, and quick-start presets
- **Three Default Presets**: Climb, Summit, and Beacon - click any tab to load them instantly

## Key Features to Try

1. **Manual Prompt Building**
   - Fill in the text fields
   - Adjust sliders for stylize, chaos, and style weight
   - Add style reference URLs
   - Watch the preview update in real-time
   - Click "Copy" to copy to clipboard

2. **AI Enhancement**
   - Fill in basic prompt details
   - Click "AI Enhance"
   - Get an optimized prompt plus 2 variants
   - Copy any variant with one click

3. **Preset Management**
   - Click "Manage" in Quick Start section
   - Save current prompt as a new preset
   - Edit or delete existing presets
   - Load presets from the tabs

4. **Save Prompts**
   - Click "Save" to store prompts in the database
   - Access saved prompts through the API at `/api/prompts`

## Helpful Commands

```bash
# View/edit database in GUI
npm run db:studio

# Re-seed the database with default presets
npm run db:seed

# Create a new database migration
npm run db:migrate
```

## Notes

- The database file (`dev.db`) is stored in the root directory
- All data persists between sessions
- Style references are automatically cleaned (query strings stripped by default)
- Prompts are formatted exactly as Midjourney expects them

## Troubleshooting

**AI Enhancement not working?**
- Make sure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
- Restart the dev server after adding the API key
- Check the browser console for any error messages

**Database errors?**
- Run `npm run db:migrate` to ensure schema is up to date
- Check that `DATABASE_URL` is set in `.env.local`

**UI components not rendering?**
- Clear `.next` directory: `rm -rf .next`
- Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

Enjoy crafting beautiful Midjourney prompts! ðŸŽ¨
